# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals
*Have at least one job offer by the end of mod 4*

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
*Practice algorithms for 2 hours per week. Work on interesting side projects that I can blog about*

#### Opportunities Research:
*Cold Outreach seems to be a good way to discover things. Angel.co has also been kind of effective* 

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*Have reached out to all alumni in places that I want to work. If possible will try to meet with people in Seattle over the long intermission*

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
*Going to keep blogging to raise online presence. Would like for LinkedIn/Facebook to not be the first hit for my name on google*

### Timeline:
*Lots of cold outreach now, in a push to make connections and possibly be interviewing in the intermission*

#### Module Tasks:
*Concentrate on projects that are useful for a resume. Keep doing cold outreach*

#### Weekly Tasks:
*Coding algorithm challenges. Push to have at least one meeting per week*

## What I Will Work on with Meg
*Still interested in the possibility of doing contract work. Wondering where and how to go about this?*
