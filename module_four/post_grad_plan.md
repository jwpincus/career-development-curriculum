## #1: Job Search Plan: Create a schedule & goals
1. Design a 40-hour "work week" that provides time for: 
	+ M-Th: 8:30 - 10: Administration; cold outreach, emails, job applications, company research, social media etc.
		10-4:30: Turn off notifications. Project work and coding. Aiming to have one iteration or deliverable/ week 
		At least one meetup per week
	+ Fri: Deploy project work, publish technical blog post about project or iteration for that week (see 'I Made a Thing' on Medium). So far my analytics analytics suggests that Twitter receives a 10x better engagement rate than Linkedin.


2. Backwards planning: What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by? 

	Job Search to end when I accept an offer... JK (kind of). Would like to have a job within 60 days of arriving in Seattle. Guessing that I'll arrive their around Aug. 10ish. So lets just aim for a start date of Oct. 1. 



3. Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals in order to reach your big goal.
	Daily: Don't break the chain (keep the Github graph green)! Commits every weekday.
	Weekly: Ship deployed code. Post a blog about the code. Reach out (cold/2nd degree) to at least 3 people in industry.
	Monthly: Interview at minimum of twice monthly. 

Keep in mind:

+ Want to improve at DevOps, and front end (JS + ux/design).
+ Plan on visiting my wife most weeks at some point. Getting 40 hours in is totally possible given my general lack of commitments, but is largely about keeping discipline.
+ I think that raising online presence will help out a lot. I've noticed that hiring people always do some cyber snooping. Having blogs and live projects online is a good way to signal my skills and abilities to employers, while also continuing to develop those skills and abilities.



4. Block out time on your calendar *now* to adhere to these goals. At the end of each week, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. 
+ Ok, done.


5. What "barriers" tend to hold you back in the job search? What steps will you take to overcome those "barriers"?

+ Getting in the door or noticed as a junior. It seems like it is especially hard to differentiate and get attention.
+ Moving to a new city might not be the best. The Turing network is super valuable, and I'll only have access to that in a small way.




## #2: Longterm Career Plan: What are your career goals?
Where do you want to go in your career? 

Reflect on this [narrative rule described by Emma Coats, former Pixar story artist](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar):

	Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. 
	Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
	
1. Imagine that it's 5 years from now - what have you accomplished during that time? How is your life different? What steps did you take to achieve your goals?

	+ Accomplished: Working as a mid-senior level developer with a team on a product that I believe in. I want to be working on code that solves problems that I think are personally interesting.
	+ Life different: Having a place to live.
	+ Concrete steps: Actively taking an interest in things outside of my domain. Sit in on sales meetings, understand the bigger picture for a company. 

2. Create a vision statement for these longterm goals.

	+ I will be a person that understands the role of technology in business, and how my skills and abilities can contribute.
	+ I will strive to advance into positions that push both my technical and personal skills.
	



3. Reference what you outlined in your Flower Exercise -- what preferred level of responsibility do you want to move to? Do you want to start your own company? What kind of work do you see yourself doing longterm? In your first year on the job, what skills do you want to develop to work towards your longterm goals?
	
	+ I want to be a person that can connect and guide a team to a solution.
	+ I really like technical work, but am also attracted to entrepreneurial side of things.
